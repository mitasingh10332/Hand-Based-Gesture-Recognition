Hand gesture recognition is the process of identifying and interpreting the
gestures made by human hands for various purposes such as sign
language, computer interface, and gaming. The objective of hand gesture
recognition is to accurately recognize and classify the gestures made by
the user in real-time, enabling intuitive interaction between humans and
computers. The key challenges in hand gesture recognition include
variability in lighting conditions, hand orientations, and occlusion. The
main goal of this technology is to provide a natural and efficient way for
humans to communicate with computers, without the need for physical
devices or touch interfaces.
